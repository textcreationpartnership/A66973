            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>1</label> THeſe two things having been, as I ſuppoſe, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prov'd in a Treatiſe of <hi>Ancient Church-Government</hi> already publiſhed, Firſt, Our Lord's deriving his Authority and Paſtoral Office here on Earth upon his Apoſtles; and this not with an equal parity. Secondly, And again, the Apoſtles transferring the ſame Office to others: And this alſo, for preventing Schiſms, and preſerving Order and Peace in the Church, done, as before, not with an exact equality amongſt all the Clergy, but with a certain preeminence and ſuperiority of ſome above the reſt, the Biſhops above the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and this a ſuperiority too not only of precedence or honour (which would not have cured Schiſms), but of Office and Authority.</p>
                  <p>I now proceed to ſhew more at large:</p>
                  <p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That</hi> conſidering men's ordinary frailties and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>there is a clear neceſſity of ſuch a Judg</hi> to decide Controverſies, reſolve Doubts, ſuppreſs falſe Doctrines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:106806:4"/>2. <hi>That there hath always been appointed in the Church of God,</hi> beſides the Rule, <hi>ſuch a Judg,</hi> both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law and under the Goſpel; and men never left to their own Conduct in Religion.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>3</label> 1. A neceſſity of ſuch a Judg ſufficiently appears from this: 1. That never any Body of Laws hath been ſo pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually ſet down, but that many doubts and queſtions do ariſe in the practice of it; a thing which experience hath verified in as many ſuch Bodies as have been made. But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Could ſuch a Law be, yet that the Canon of Scripture is far from being ſuch as to every part thereof, is evident from the many Controverſies of Religion, that are on foot amongſt thoſe who all acknowledg the ſame Canon, and who muſt be ſaid, at leaſt ſome of them on all ſides, to be both of quick capacity and ſober judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memt, and ſufficient integrity: ſeeing that almoſt whole Nations have thus oppoſed one another, all whoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities or integrities it were too much uncharitableneſs and pride to queſtion. Here therefore whereas fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently both the contrary parties uſe to ſay the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is plain on their own ſide, they both ſhew that it is difficult; and whereas both alſo could wiſh an Arbiter of Controverſies at leaſt to ſilence their Adverſary, they mutually confeſs One neceſſary for them both. And ſo long as ſober Judgments contradict in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Scripture, tho both ſhould ſay, that the Scripture is clear, yet neither can ſay that in reſpect of all men it is ſo. And ſo long there is neceſſary another Judg beſides Scripture, eſpecially when none in Religious matters will confeſs that they conteſt about a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie which is not neceſſary to be decided. Indeed this happens ordinarily, that ſome ſentences of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106806:4"/>ſeem plain on one ſide, and other ſentences thereof plain on another; but ſince all parts of Divine truth muſt cohere and accord, the more plainneſs in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner makes it the more difficult. And therefore, we commonly ſee, that in their not well-comparing of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Scriptures, but faſtning their thoughts only on ſome parcel thereof, to which their fancy or intereſt ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally guides them, the more ignorant are the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, and leſt doubting, and they who have leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd things, ſooneſt decide them. And thus thoſe who have the Scriptures the more common, and open to each man's comment (without dependance on any other Judg than themſelves) run into great varieties of Opinions and Sects. 2 St. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. takes notice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a chief part of the Scriptures, and that written purpoſely for inſtruction, St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles; [but not only concerning theſe, but the other Scriptures too, ſee the end of <hi>v.</hi> 16.] that in them there were <hi>ſome things hard to be underſtood, which they that were unlearned and unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble did wreſt to their own destruction.</hi> Theſe things then of conſequence, the miſtaking of which tended to the Miſtaker's deſtruction; which yet men, even in his days, miſtook by being <hi>unlearned, i. e.</hi> not well taught in Chriſtianity, which teaching they muſt have from their Paſtors; and <hi>unſtable,</hi> which muſt be by departing from the Doctrines receiv'd from their Paſtors, as the words following <hi>v.</hi> 17. alſo imply. Now I ſee not why the ſame accident concerning the ſame Scriptures ſhould not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſtill to the illiterate and unſtable, diſclaiming any other Judg ſave theſe Scriptures, and conceiting that God's Written Word hath render'd his Miniſters uſeleſs. This is ſaid for the neceſſity of a Judg in matters of Religion, where Scriptures indeed (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith of them) have ſome difficulty. But</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:106806:5"/>3. Since Controverſies may be raiſed and maintain'd by the peeviſhneſs, and perverſneſs, and paſſion of a Party, even where Scriptures are clear enough, here alſo no leſs neceſſary is a Judg juridically to ſuppreſs and ſilence thoſe who <hi>irrationally,</hi> and many times with <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocatacriſie,</hi> thus offend. But</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is poſſible alſo, that ſome very material Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies there may be in Religion, wherein the Scriptures have either been ſilent, or have not ſpoken to them ſo expreſly and openly, but that they muſt be drawn out from thence by ſeveral deductions. Here then alſo ſome other Judg is neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> Such a <hi>Judg</hi> therefore is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>ſuch a Judg there always hath been appointed by God</hi> to be conſulted and ſubmitted-to by his people; both before the Law Written, and under the Law Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and under the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>In the times before the Law Written,</hi> even from the very infancy of-the World, God ever had a Church, contradiſtinct after <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall (of whoſe Sons, as ſome were, good, ſo others were impious) to the reſt of the world, ſerving God in a publick external Communion, and under ſeveral other Laws beſides that of Nature written in every man's Conſcience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15.

Again, it is nor meant of doing neither what this Court ſhall direct, that is in ſuch things, wherein meanwhile we are not bound to think alſo their determination law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and their ſentence juſt. As one may lawfully pay a mulct of an 100 l. wherein he is condemned by the Court, without thinking their ſentence lawful; becauſe any one, when wrong is done him, may <hi>cedere ſuo jure,</hi> without ſinning therein. Thus Mr. <hi>Chilling worth</hi> would avoid this place urged by Mr. <hi>Knot;</hi> and in his inſtance indeed no more is required than he affirms; but it ſeemeth alſo an obligation to think ſuch determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and ſentence juſt and lawful: as in all thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may be made appear, where the party is enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Court to perform ſome neglected duty to God, or his Neighbour, and not only ſentenced to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go ſome puniſhiment; as certainly all the decrees and determinations of that Court were not only about paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience, ſatisfactions, and puniſhments, but active too, duties, and ſervice. Now this is certain, that none may do any thing which he doth not firſt think is lawful to be done, or at leaſt which, he doth not go ſo far, as to think that it is unlawful to be done: for, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientia erronea obligat.</hi> And next, he cannot think ſuch thing lawful to be done, ſo long as he thinketh that God hath forbidden it, or commanded the contrary of it to be done.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106806:9"/>but that the determination of this court is right, and juſt. But here if any one would ſay; That one may think a thing lawful to be done by him, becauſe it is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him by thoſe Superiors, whom God hath charged him in all things to obey, whilſt meanwhile he believeth God to have commanded the contrary, and that hence only he thinketh it lawful for him to do it; not becauſe God hath commanded it, or hath not commanded the contrary, but becauſe God hath commanded him to obey his Superiors, tho erring and decreeing a thing ſometimes contrary to God's command. Let it be ſo: This ſufficeth our purpoſe, ſo that conſtant obedience be allowed to theſe Judges, and that what they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand we ought to do, not only in matters of Penalty, but of Duty.

                  <p>Some of thoſe particular Doctrines of the Phariſees in this kind, which we find our Saviour to have taxed, are theſe.

In whoſe time alſo <hi>Hezethiah</hi> his Son was rightly educated and inſtructed in the true Religion, reforming all as ſoon as he came to the Crown; in whoſe time alſo were many Prophets, <hi>Iſaiah, Hoſea, Amos, Micah,</hi> and others, who both inſtructed the people, and animated and confirmed the Prieſts in God's true worſhip: and the diſhonourable burial of <hi>Ahaz</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.17. ſhews neither the Nobility, nor Clergy, nor people, generally addicted to his Apoſtacy; whoſe Progenitors alſo <hi>

And if you ask, What if that, which is now a Minor part amongſt theſe Eccleſiaſtical Judges, and is condemn'd by the reſt, in time happens to over-number the reſt?

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106806:20"/>do go out, are eaſily diſcern'd by their paucity; tho after wards ſuch a defection may be, that they may out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>number the Catholicks themſelves.

And ſo I have done with the Oeconomy of God's Church under the Law; where (to look back a little, before I proceed farther to the times of the Goſpel): 1. I do not ſay, That no Written Law can be plain enough for men to learn out of it, without any authoriz'd Expoſitor thereof, all Faith and Duty neceſſary to Salvation; or for men to incur juſt Damnation in not yeilding Obedience to its Rules. And therefore I do not ſay, That an Expoſitor or Judg is abſolutely neceſſary beſides any ſuch Law in this reſpect, tho for many other reſpects he is, as hath been ſhew'd before. Neither do I affirm, that if God giveth us not together with his Laws ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal infallible Expoſitor of them, he would be unjuſt or deficient in his Providence: For the contrary of this appears in Heatheniſm, where men, having no external but fallible Guides, yet having the Law of Nature, and an internal Judg and Expoſitor thereof, their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (which in many of thoſe Laws erreth not, except in the moſt deſperate and obdurate ſinners, and which, whether they will or no, within gives a right ſentence againſt them) are for offending againſt this Law juſtly condemn'd, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. comp. 12.2. Neither do I ſay, that where God hath not appointed any one to ſeek the meaning of his Laws from anothers mouth, there he may not (<hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> that is, where he thinks his own abilities as great as other mens) judg for himſelf; and we ought to preſume, that where God
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106806:25"/>hath ſet no ſuch Directors over us, there his Laws are delivered with clearneſs enough to be underſtood by our ſelves. But 3ly, This only I ſay, That thoſe to whom God in his overflowing goodneſs hath beſides his Laws left alſo Guides, and commanded them to obey theſe, ſuch cannot innocently withdraw their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from theſe Guides; ought not to uſe their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate judgment againſt theſe; are ſafe, if theſe Guides err, in following them, tho not the Guides ſafe, in no better conducting them; and that, tho in ſome times, theſe Guides, to whom God referreth us, for knowing his will, may be much more corrupt than in others; yet that theſe, by God's care over his people, can never ſo groſly erre, as that their followers ſhall not receive from their doctrines all neceſſary knowledge for ſalvation; and that this is ſufficient to tie us always to their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. 1. Becauſe we cannot promiſe our ſelves this ſecurity in following our own private judgments, which we have in following theirs, for private men are not ſecure upon their own judgment from falling into fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental errors, as perhaps the Sadduces did in relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing the <hi>Moſes</hi>-chair-men of their times. 2ly. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if any mortal error ſhould be ſuppoſed to have ſeazed upon theſe Supreme Governours, on whom by his appointment all others depend, it is to be hoped that God will never ſuffer it long, but either change their opinions, or the perſons.

                  <p>Now 4ly. That this Hearing and Obedience due to them, is not only an obligation of non-contradicting, but of aſſenting to ſuch their Doctrines, and Deciſions of Controverſies, ſo far as they require aſſent; appears likewiſe from the aforenam'd Texts, as likewiſe thoſe following. Becauſe theſe Church-Officers are call'd Teachers and Guides, which have reference to Truth, as well as Judges and Rulers, which have reference to Peace; and we charg'd to hear them, as Chriſt; who alſo have receiv'd from Chriſt a Spirit leading them into all Truth, and a promiſe <hi>that the Gates of Hell ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prevail againſt them, &amp;c.</hi> Of which more anon.

That their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may not be <hi>carried about with every wind of doctrine,</hi> by the ſleight of men; not carried about with them, <hi>i.e.</hi> not believe them. Now he who by theſe Superiors may be reſtrain'd from believing them, is hereby enjoin'd to believe the contradictories of them, namely,, the Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106806:30"/>of the Church; and if the people are enjoin'd to believe this, then alſo their Seducers. But were the people oblig'd only to the obedience of non-contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not of aſſent toward ſuch Superiors; then where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſome Tenents are excluſive of Salvation, and many more having dangerous effects upon the lives and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Chriſtians, ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 15.24.—2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. (and wherefore are the Teachers prohibited, if the Doctrines were not pernicious, and to be renounc'd?) Yet is there no Church-authority which can afford any remedy to this great evil. It can indeed provide for its own peace, but not its ſubjects ſafety, whilſt it muſt tolerate the liberty of all (tho deſtructive) opinions; and may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act no more than a non-gainſaying. Again; Becauſe it is clear, that theſe Church-Guides may not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and excommunicate falſe Teachers and Seducers, but the Heretical alſo, when any way they come to be diſcover'd guilty thereof; conſider <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10, 11. where obſerve <hi>ver.</hi> 11. that their <hi>autocatacriſie,</hi> or being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by their own Conſcience, (tho there be no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, by divulging their Hereſie, of infecting other men's Conſciences therewith) is render'd a ſufficient ground of their rejection; nor may ſuch Heretical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be reſtor'd again to the Church's Communion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his engaging to conceal his Hereſie, but upon his quitting and renouncing it. Since then theſe Church-Guides have power to excommunicate Hereticks, <hi>i. e.</hi> men for holding falſe Opinions in matters of Faith; <hi>i. e.</hi> men for their diſſent, at leaſt after ſome previous admonitions, and reaſons ſufficient to convince; or men for their obſtinacy in diſſent; which obſtinacy is not delible but by yeilding aſſent. This I ſay infers, that there is due to theſe Church-Guides an Obedience of Aſſent; or elſe theſe Guides may excommunicate one
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106806:30"/>for not-performing an Obedience which is not due. (See this more largely proſecuted in <hi>Oblig.</hi> of <hi>Judgm.</hi> § 4.) And again, conſider 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.11.—6.3, 5. where the Apoſtle writes thus to <hi>Timothy; Theſe things command and teach,</hi> —and <hi>if any man do teach otherwiſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth not to wholeſome words, &amp;c. from ſuch withdraw thy ſelf.</hi> Laſtly, Becauſe at leaſt <hi>in Agendis,</hi> in all thoſe things which by theſe Eccleſiaſtical Judges are requir'd to be done, we muſt either yeild the obedience of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or we can yeild none at all (ſave that call'd Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Obedience, which is a ſubmitting to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appointed for diſobedience); for who can oblige to do a thing, doth oblige us alſo to think it lawful to be done, elſe we may never do it. If then this Church-Authority may ſo far, <hi>in Agendis,</hi> determine to us <hi>what is lawful or unlawful;</hi> as, herein, to exact aſſent from us to her Judgment; why may it not in the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>in Credendis,</hi> determine to us <hi>what is true and falſe?</hi> Or, what reaſon can there be, that this ſhould be more unerring, or more creditable, in truths practical than ſpeculative, where both equally neceſſary.</p>

Which Guide, when as this Spiritual Court conſiſts not of one, but many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, when ever there is any diſagreement therein, muſt be the major part; and, when as there is alſo an eſtabliſhed ſubordination of theſe perſons and courts; muſt be the ſuperior rather than the inferior perſons, and the more univerſal and comprehenſive Synods, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than thoſe Synods which are of a leſs circuit, and ſmaller company; otherwiſe any Heretick, if a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, may be entertained for a guide: and whenas our Saviour has enjoined the people to obey their guides, yet hath this people no means to know who theſe are, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when all the Clergy of the Univerſe are of one opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Now he that appoints us to follow a Guide in what he ſhall enjoin us, and then leaves us no way (when our Guide conſiſts not of one but many perſons, and two parties of them contradict one another) to know which of them is to be our Guide; it is all one, as if he left us no Guide: And he that ties us, beſide the uſe of our own judgment, to obey and follow ſome Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical perſon or other only, not obliging to the moſt or major part, to a ſuperior more than inferior perſon or Court, revolves our obedience only to our own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>i.e.</hi> to chuſe that ſide which we judge the righteſt, as we follow the counſel of that friend, who we do think ſpeaketh moſt reaſon, without acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging any obedience to his authority, and then left to this choice; what opinion can we take up ſo abſurd, in which we cannot find ſome Clergy-man or other for a Leader?

I ſay, may not this alſo reaſonably be concluded for theſe Reaſons? 1. Becauſe we find no reſtriction of our Saviour's promiſe of aſſiſtance, only for theſe abſolutely neceſſary fundamentals; and there muſt be granted need of this his aſſiſtance further, ſo long as there is granted further danger. 2. Becauſe if we confine the non-failing guidance of theſe Church-guides only to abſolute neceſſaries, this will not extend ſo far as the points of the three Creeds, a very few Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of which are by the Learned thought Truths ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106806:32"/>neceſſary. 3. Becauſe thoſe of the Church-Doctors will not conſent to an univerſal inerrability of theſe Church-guides, but reſtrain it only to ſome truths; whereas the Scriptures make no limitation, but do it on ſuch pretences as theſe. 1. Becauſe thoſe wherein they ſay theſe may err, are by-and unneceſſary truths, to which the Churches curioſity or weakneſs may carry her beyond her Rule. See Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> § 21. <hi>n.</hi> 5. <hi>2ly.</hi> Becauſe they are unprofitable curioſities and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary ſubtilities, for which the Promiſe was not made; becauſe <hi>Deus non abundat in ſuperfluis.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſuch points as may be variouſly held and diſputed, without hurt or prejudice to faith. See Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> § 5. <hi>p.</hi> 150. &amp;c. <hi>3ly.</hi> So then in all dangerous points, as well as in abſolutely neceſſary, the Divine aſſiſtance and the Church-guides infallibility I hope will be ſtill allowed. <hi>2ly.</hi> They ſay, the Church errs not in abſolutely Fundamentals, becauſe the Word of God in all ſuch points is ſo plainly and manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto Her, that it is not poſſible that ſhe ſhould univerſally fall from it, or teach againſt it. See Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> § 21. <hi>n.</hi> 5: But then there ſeems alſo to be good reaſon, why other points dangerous to ſalvation, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining fundamentals, ſhould be delivered clearly in the ſame Word of God; or if not clearly, there is the more reaſon ſtill, that the Churches-guides ſhould be infallibly aſſiſted in theſe, which both are dangerous, and the Churches Rule (the Scriptures) in them obſcure.

And if aſsent muſt be granted to them in neceſsaries, then, as Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> moſt acutely obſerved, to all that they ſhall judge a Neceſsary. <q>[If (<hi>ſaith he, p.</hi> 150.) the Church be an infallible Director in Fundamentals, then muſt we not only learn fundamentals of Her, but alſo learn of Her what is fundamental, and take for funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental which ſhe believes to be ſuch: In performance whereof <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> if I knew any one Church to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, I would quickly be of that Church.]</q> This will hold at leaſt for ſo many of Chriſtians, as will not pretend the skill themſelves of ſeparating neceſsaries, and not-neceſsaries. And theſe Church-guides judging what is neceſsary, eſpecially if they take it in ſuch a larger ſence as we have ſhewed but now, that they have reaſon to preſume of our Saviour's aſſiſtance therein, then perhaps ſo many of their deciſions will receive from them the denomination of Neceſsary, as that we ſhall not think meet, whilſt aſsenting to all theſe, to diſsent from them in the reſt. But however, if we yeild aſsent to all theſe, good reaſon there is why we ſhould alſo in all the reſt, (abſtracting from matters of fact, and matters not Spiritual) only putting in this excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleſs any happen to be infallibly certain of the contrary to what they decide, (for whoſoever is ſo, I grant cannot yeild aſsent;) but how any one ſhould be ſo, (debarring new revelations, and his having any Divine evidence which the Church-guides have not as well as He,) I do not ſee; eſpecially when alſo having propoſed to theſe Church-guides all the reaſons and grounds of his infallible certainty, yet he hath not made them ſo.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Seeing that (if I may transfer the Apoſtle's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 3. from perſons to things) theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet over us to regulate our Judgment in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt matters, how can they be conceiv'd unfit to do it in the leſſer?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Seeing that by our not-yeilding aſſent to all their Deciſions, even thoſe alſo in non-neceſſaries, ſo long as they have made no diſtinct partition of theſe two, we may incur a peril of with-drawing our aſſent in ſome thing neceſſary; but by aſſenting to all, we are ſure to have a right perſwaſion in all neceſſaries, wherein theſe Guides have a Warrant not to fail; but not ſo, private men undertaking to Guide themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Seeing that in our erring together with our Guides (who are thus alſo to give an account for our errors, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.) ſo long as it is in non-neceſſaries, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is not dangerous; but on the other ſide there may be a great fault in us, in denying due obedience, tho in ſmall matters.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Seeing that thoſe who moſt vindicate the liberty of their own judgments, do, to make theſe Guides the more liable to fallibility in non-neceſſaries, plead the Scriptures to be in ſuch points leſs perſpicuous; but on the contrary, this imperſpicuity of them in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures argues the more need in them of Guides.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Seeing that private men have reaſon to preſume, that the Judment of ſo many, ſo learned ſo ancient, as theſe Eccleſiaſtical Courts uſe to conſiſt of, is, where
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106806:34"/>not abſolutely infallible, yet much to be preferr'd before their own, <hi>i.e.</hi> that of one ſingle perſon, or of a few not ſo learned, not ſo experienc'd. So Children wiſely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Parents, and Scholars their Maſters, tho falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Judgments. Or putting our ſelves equal every-way, in parts, in learning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to all theſe; yet what help or means have we, or what diligence do we uſe to diſcern Truth which theſe do not? Conſult we former Church and Tradition? ſo do they: And ſince the Writings of the Fathers, as well as the Divine, are liable to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers conſtructions and miſunderſtandings, doubtleſs their expoſition of theſe, as well as of the Scriptures, is to be preferr'd to private men's. Again, theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church-Guides, in any oppoſition or difference from the former Church-Guides, having as high an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as they, if we pretend to yeild obedience to the one, ſo we muſt to the other. Conſult we the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures? and what Scriptures have we, which they have not, and which we have not firſt from them? And what can be clear therein to us, which is not ſo to them? Or ſince no place of Scripture, tho never ſo plain in its terms, may be ſo underſtood, as will render it contradictory to any other place, how can ſuch a man be ſecure enough of his diligence and wit in making ſuch a due collation of Scriptures, and collecting a right ſenſe, where he findeth ſuch a Body to oppoſe him?</p>
                  <p>But perhaps theſe Guides, tho more knowing then he, yet have not like integrity. And what miſguiding paſſions are theſe ſubject to in judging, to which our ſelves are not much more? Or what ſelf-intereſt do we find in them, but only when we have a contrary our ſelves? Every one imagines himſelf to ſtand in an indifferency to Opinions, when as indeed ſcarce any, by reaſon of their education, fortunes, particular depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106806:34"/>and relations, is ſo; and mean-while, like Icte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical perſons, he thinks that colour to be in thoſe he looks upon abroad, which is only in himſelf. I know no greater ſign of a dis-intereſted, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate temper of mind, than to be apt readily to ſubmit to another's judgment; and ſeldom it is, but much ſelf-conceit and ſpiritual pride do accompany ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of Opinion. This have I ſaid, to ſhew what reaſons there are for our aſſent to the Doctrines and Determinations of our Spiritual Guides, drawn from that meaſure of aſſiſtance and infallibility which our Lord hath promiſed them; tho other Scriptures had laid on us ſuch injunction.

And if thus ſearching, we find the Doctrines of our Teachers contrary to the Scriptures ſo expounded, we may and ought to with-draw our belief from them. Or this trial, <hi>3ly,</hi> by Scriptures, is of the doctrines of the Church, <hi>i.e.</hi> of thoſe doctrines which are deliver'd, not by a private Teacher, but by a general conſent of the Church-guides (at leaſt the fulleſt that we can diſcover).

                  <p>And therefore as there are ſome Scriptures, that bid us <hi>ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> becauſe if we do this aright we ſhall never find them to diſagree from the Doctrines of

In anſwer to the former, the Scriptures: It is granted, that it ſeems in theſe latter times of the world there ſhall be a great falling away from the faith; but that it is from Chriſtianity it ſelf, and from the Church; as indeed we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeen all thoſe flouriſhing Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and other Eaſtern and Southern parts, once Chriſtian, now over-run by the Doctrine of the Great Prophet of God, as he ſtiled himſelf, <hi>Mahomet;</hi> who ſits and triumphs in thoſe ſame places which were once the chiefeſt Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God; and the love of many to Chriſt waxen cold by the abounding of iniquity, and the terrible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections of the Turkiſh Empire, the Image of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Perſecutor, the Heathen Roman Empire, to which Imago <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s doctrine hath given life and vigor; and this deceſſion we have ſeen, and what more ſhall be ſeen hereafter, God knoweth.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106806:42"/>Fidelity; That which makes good men, making good Subjects. 4ly, And again, becauſe, That where any takes away another's right, both Divine Juſtice ſentences him to looſe his own, and his Example teaches others to invade it].</p>

Now what Authority they had before, amidſt the oppoſitions of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular power, they cannot loſe it, nor any part of it ſince, by this Powers ſubmitting it ſelf unto Chriſt's Scepter, and to the Church. Greater then this Church-authority might be made, many ways, by Princes: by granting the Church (now) ſome temporal priviledges; by making the Acts of the Church their Law alſo; and by enforcing it on all their Subjects (as well Clergy as Laiety) with corporal puniſhments and the temporal ſword, further than the other could ſingly with his Spiritual; which yet (experience ſhews) was able a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone both to preſerve order and diſcipline amongſt its Subjects.

                  <p>Therefore all the eſtabliſhing and reſtoring of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> (from whoſe having power in advancing Religion tis ſtrange to ſee, how ſome ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue their having the ſole power,) were only by, and in aſſiſtance of, the Prieſt, never againſt him, and they commanded often the Prieſts to perform, what the Prieſts together with them conſented to be their duty.

But no where can we find that they decided controverſies againſt the Prieſts; or, that the ſucceſſion of Prieſts maintaining a falſe Religion, the King againſt them vindicated the true; or in their ſtead, becauſe erroneous, appointed, and made new Prieſts; becauſe indeed the Succeſſion of Prieſts never apoſtatized from the whole body of true Religion, nor ever ſhall; but ſhould they, yet why not the Prince ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? and whom then finally is it fit to rely on for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? But for thoſe parts of true Religion, wherein the Clergy was defective, (as it happened under the later Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and in the times of our Saviour, they were reformeable only by extraordinary Prophets ſent from God; whom in all times the people lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, and repaired to, for judgment, as they did to the Prieſts, (fee before) but neither people nor Princes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Prieſts upon this pretence; and therefore thoſe Texts, wherein the Prophets blame the errors of the

That concerning points or truths neceſſary to ſalvation, the Suppoſition is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, until our Saviour ſhall cancel his promiſe of their indefectibility in ſuch neceſſaries. 2ly. That for any other Spiritual matters (wherein perhaps they may err,) yet the Temporal Magiſtrate may not reform: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, he that in Spiritual things is to learn of them what is truth, and what error, can never judge when they err, unleſs they firſt tell him ſo. What, you will ſay, cannot judge? when as he hath the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures left to demonſtrate to him truth and error? I ask, were they left to him alone? or hath he any evidence therefrom, which the Clergy hath not? Or doth the Secular man ſtudy them more than they, who make this their employment and trade? Yes: but their eyes are blinded in many things with ſelf-intereſt, namely in thoſe, which ſome way concern their own privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1. Then in all Doctrines no way advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the priviledges of the Church, the Prince may not ſwerve from its judgment. Well it were, if but ſo much were obſerved. But 2ly. For theſe matters of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, it were ſomething that were ſaid, if where the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106806:45"/>Eccleſiaſtical power were intereſted on the one ſide of the controverſy, the Secular power (which claims right to judge) were not as much on the other; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever priviledges were taken from the one, were not devolved upon the other. For example: If <hi>Henry</hi> 8th. and his Lords had took the Supremacy in Church-affairs from the Pope, and not transferred on themſelves, it were ſomething (tho not ſufficient) that were ſaid: but in ſuch concernments men being equal, judge in which we have reaſon to expect the more integrity, that they will not claim more than their due. But 3ly. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that our Saviour had granted his Church ſome great priviledges, (as ſuch a thing is poſſible); either theſe priviledges by them muſt not be maintained, or ſuch a cavil cannot be prevented. But methinks this is enough to preſerve truth in their ſentence, (who are moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted men of conſcience,) tho in matters concerning themſelves, That by a falſe judgment a greater intereſt hereafter is loſt, than is for the preſent gained.</p>

Some of them beſtow it on the Civil Magiſtrate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limitation, ſo as to oblige all men, without diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to obey, whatever in theſe things he determines; as a Country-man of ours. But this is ſo groſs a tenent, I need ſpend no labour to ſhew the many horrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences thereof. Some again beſtow it upon the ſame ſupreme Magiſtrate, ſo as to oblige men only to obey him (I mean actively) in what they think not
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106806:45"/>contrary to the Divine Laws; and for other things, which they think contrary, not to reſiſt any puniſhment inflicted on them for not obeying actively, <hi>i. e.</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and practiſing as that Magiſtrate appoints. Thus <hi>G. Voſſius, H. Grotius (Jus Imp. circa Sacra),</hi> and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily Proteſtants. <hi>Voſſius</hi> repreſents the matter briefly thus, in an Epiſtle inſerted in <hi>Praeſtantium Virorum, Ep. p.</hi> 167. <hi>Synodi falli poſſunt, Magiſtratus non debet iis cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere propter ſe; ſed quia conſentiunt cum Scripturis &amp; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonibus antiquis. Et haec [Synodus] et ille errori eſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxius, ſed hoc non impedit, quo minus &amp; Synodi Officium ſit dirigere intellectum in cognitionem veri, tum magiſtratus, imperare, quod rectum eſt &amp; ſalutare.</hi> — <hi>Quodſi illa dirigit male, non ideo hic imperabit male; &amp; ſi hic imperet malum, non ideo ſubditi parere debent in malo. Sed &amp; Magiſtrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus &amp; ſubditus unuſquiſque aget, quod ſui eſſe officii Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura, &amp; Eccleſiae Catholicae conſenſus, &amp; recta ratio, perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerit</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> what Scripture, Church, or Reaſon, ſeems to him to perſwade]. But may the Magiſtrate then puniſh here thoſe that diſobey his commands? Yes, ſaith he, — <hi>Rex &amp; illud imperare debet, quod in verbo juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit Deus, &amp; paenarum comminatione obſtringere ad illud ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor poteſt, nec in his imperium detrectare cuiquam licet. In his,</hi> if he means which both Prince and Subject are agreed to be God's Word, this is certain. But mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, if the, Subject apprehends that contrary to God's Word, which the Magiſtrate ſaith is not, and commands as his Word, here the Subject may and ought to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey him. And upon this the queſtion ſtill proceeds: How the Magiſtrate may juſtly puniſh the Subject for not doing a thing, where the Subject alſo may lawfully diſobey, and not do it? One would think, either the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ought to be certain that what he commands is right before he may puniſh any for diſobeying his
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106806:46"/>command; or the Subject ought to be certain that what he commands is not right, before he may diſobey it. But yet neither is the one, or the other, held any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Judg in theſe matters we ſpeak of Nor yet do theſe men leave any third perſon, that being ſo, may guide and regulate them. But the one lawfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and puniſhes him for that, which the other law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſobeys. Where in effect every one in things Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual is finally committed to his own Judgment; whilſt they leave none at all above others, that may ſo decide what is contrary to God's Law, what not, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain ſubmiſſion thereto, further than their private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concurs. And the only abſolute obligation we have to any of their commands, is to non-reſiſtance of the puniſhment. But then ſuppoſe one thinks this alſo; namely, that we ſhould be bound in all caſes (even where we are innocent, or alſo truly religious) to non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be a thing contrary to Scripture, (as there want not many of late who have been ſo perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,) then their commands will oblige ſuch an one in no ſenſe at all, and ſo indeed will be no commands as to ſuch a perſon; for <hi>effectus imperii eſt obligatio:</hi> Laſtly, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, theſe men do give to the Church, is (except that which ſhe derives from the Civil power) only <hi>regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſuaſorium,</hi> or <hi>declarativum,</hi> and ſo <hi>ſine obligandi jure.</hi> But this is making our obedience to her (if it may be ſo call'd at all) no more than that we give to any other private man, adminiſtring, as we think, good Counſel to us; which is ſufficiently confuted before. Only in all this you may obſerve; That whilſt theſe wary Factors for Truth are afraid to acknowledg ſuch an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience enjoin'd to the Church, as, to believe that to be the meaning of the Divine Law, or not; to be truth, or error, that ſhe tells them to be ſo, (&amp; then much leſs can
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106806:46"/>allow ſuch an obedience to Secular power,) they in avoiding theſe two, yeild this judgment of what is truth, what is not in theſe matters of higheſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be left by God to every one; which expoſeth the Chriſtian world to far more, and groſſer errors, (as daily experience thereof ſheweth), than would in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability either of the other: But yet this pleaſeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thus the ſtaters of the queſtion make themſelves alſo Judges.

God hath given charge to the Clergy over the flock, but where hath he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the charge of the Clergy to the Prince? Perhaps the common ſence of Chriſtians ſhall judge. But are the Guides of the Church then only void of it, and that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106806:48"/>in their own faculty? Common ſence of the Chriſtian Laity, what if they differ then in their common ſence, are we not then to follow the major part of them? But ſo alſo the Reformed are caſt, the major part of Lay-Chriſtians entertaining the Roman Tenents.</p>
                  <p>Again, we have given up this right of the Church to the Prince, where now ſhall we ſtay? If one Prince may do the office of a Council, and if need be decide matters of Faith for the Clergy; why may not the next, if need be, Ordain for the Biſhop, or depoſe that Order obſtinate in error? Is this a dream? are there not alſo thoſe who claim this? But then again, if where the Clergy fails the Prince may take our Saviour's Chair, and judge, then ſuppoſing the Prince alſo through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice or ignorance <hi>&amp;c</hi> may fail too; (Is there not ſome Common-wealth, that hath been lately under God's judgments in this condition?)

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>74</label> To clear this point, we muſt know, that where ever any diviſion happens in the Church; and that one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which was at firſt eſtabliſhed in a perfect not co- but ſub-ordination, divides into two, and each or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Succeſſors to their party, one is to be counted no lawful ſucceſſion. Elſe, ſince ſome Teachers there ſhall be that will differ from the reſt; and in all ſects we may find ſome Clergy or other for us to follow; the Church will have neither any ſuch property, as <hi>unity</hi> of her faith; nor will there be any ſuch crime as Schiſm from it. Therefore the Church may and ought, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of her purity, and unity, to excommunicate, exauthorize, and ſeparate her ſelf and her children from ſuch as are falſe Teachers, and walk diſorderly, that ſhe might not be partaker of, nor countenance them in, nor encourage more to follow, their ſin; according to the frequent commands of Scriptures, forequoted, ſee 2 <hi>Jo.</hi> 10, 11. <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.17, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19, 21. compared with 18. — <hi>Iniquity,</hi> i.e. errors, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.6, 15, 16. (texts abuſed by ſome to juſtify a ſeparation from the Church it ſelf,) therefore alſo none can lawfully communicate both with the true and with an Heretical or Schiſmatical Church: who tho they hold ſufficient truth, yet are to be refuſed and avoided for the breach of unity, and that without reſpect to the numbers of the revolted, or to the liability of the Church, they deſert, to ſome (non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtructive)
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106806:49"/>errors. And this practice the Church hath always obſerved, and the perſons ſo diſauthorized by it, if afterward uſing their functions, were in the Primitive times eſteemed guilty of ſin, and ſacriledge; and ſo thoſe alſo, by them ordained. And when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the Catholick faith (as many <hi>Arian</hi> Biſhops did) they might not officiate, till by a Declaration and reabilitation of the Church they were reſtored to the exerciſe of that authority, of which they were by her formerly deprived. For we muſt know, that tho ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common Tenent of die Church (ſee <hi>Conc. Nice</hi> 8. <hi>Can.</hi>) none that is ordained (according to the right form of Ordination) by a Heretick, or Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, may be reordained, no more than one baptized by ſuch may be rebaptized, or the Euchariſt conſecrated by ſuch reconſecrated; but when he recants his Hereſy, or Schiſm, he being only relicenſed by the Church, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth his function by vertue of his formerly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Orders. Yet who ſo by Hereſy or Schiſm is once deprived of the right of <hi>exerciſing his function,</hi> (as any one may be,) cannot confer this right on others, but that all theſe afterwards ſtand as much ſuſpended from any execution of their offices, as himſelf doth. Tho I cannot ſay, but that the Effects of the Sacraments, and other offices of their function, as well in other things as in Baptiſm, (as in Marriages, in Penance, and Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Euchariſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are ſtill valid to the ſimple Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, who is guiltleſs of their faults, the wickedneſs of the Miniſter (if truly ordained) not hindering the benefits to mankind, which Chriſt hath annext to that Office, and which always himſelf (as the principal Agent) by their hands confers.</p>

For to thoſe that are guilty of this, tho their former Ordination, and the Character (as ſome call that impreſſed by it) is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled, and blotted out, (for which cauſe, as I ſaid, when ſuch perſons were reconciled, and readmitted to their functions, they were not reordained,) yet all the authority and right of diſcharging their function is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by the Church, and ceaſeth; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then ceaſeth this <hi>power</hi> of ordaining others. See <hi>Canon Apoſt.</hi> 67.63. <hi>Cons. Nice. can.</hi> 19.8. And the ſame caſe, I ſuppoſe, it is of thoſe who are condemned, tho not guilty, and who are excommunicated and thruſt out of the Church never ſo unjuſtly; for they yet deſiring the communion denied them, ſhew their approbation ſo far of it, as that they may not ordain others againſt that, wherein they grant is preſerved the unity of the Faith; tho I think, that ſimply an unjuſt Excommunication never made ſuch a manner of diviſion in the Church; but that thoſe, who have ſet up new communions, have ſtill diſallowed ſome Tenents or practices of the former, for which they would not, if permitted, return to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with her; tho they ſeem to juſtify their new communion, chiefly upon the pretence of being caſt out of the former. Now Schiſm (as the former times un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it) is any relinquiſhing, and departing, upon what pretence ſoever, from the former external com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, (when we cannot ſhew that it hath departed from the former external communion of its Predeceſſors), where we muſt grant was before
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:106806:50"/>the unity of the faith, (becauſe there was no Chriſtian communion at all beſides it,) and in that faith, ſalvation (undeniably) to be had, and its judgment in all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of faith, and interpretations of Scriptures, to be obeyed. Now who depart thus, are alſo eaſily diſcerned: 1. By the paucity of their number, if we look not at the Succeſſion, but at the beginning of the Breach; tho afterward (in ſome places at leaſt) it may outnumber the Orthodox.

By the conſtitutions of the Church Ordinations are unlawful, not only, where not ſuch perſons, as the Canons of the Church have appointed, do ordain, (as one no Biſhop); or not ſuch a number; (as for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Biſhop, leſs than three, where cannot be ſhewed an irremediable neceſſity, [which neceſſity where truly it is, and not pretended to be, if you pleaſe we will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Presbyters alſo may do the Office, or propagate the Order of Biſhops; or the Chriſtian people create all theſe to themſelves; or in practiſing the duties, and retaining the faith of Chriſtianity, be ſaved without ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Adminiſtrations; but what will this avail thoſe, who pretend ſuch neceſſities, when they live in the middle of the boſom of the Church of God, and the original miniſtery thereof?] but alſo, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a greater part of the Biſhops of ſuch a Province op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than conſent to it. See Mr. <hi>Thorndikes</hi> conceſſion, <hi>Right of the Church</hi> p. 148. 250. 147. The Reaſon: becauſe Ordinations were to have bin made only by the Provincial Councils, which were to be held frequently,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106806:50"/>(twice a year); in defect of theſe, the execution of it was committed to three, or in a caſe of neceſſity to one; but preſuppoſing the conſent, and that by letters of the reſt, or the major part of them. See <hi>Conc. Nic.</hi> 4. <hi>Can. Conc. Nicen. can.</hi> 6. <hi>Apoſt. can.</hi> 1.36, 38. <hi>Ap. Conſt. l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 27. Elſe the unity of the Church can no way be preſerv'd: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Novatianus</hi> ordain'd for Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> by Three, was forc'd to yeild to <hi>Cornelius</hi> Ordain'd by Sixteen. Again, it was caution'd, That all the Biſhops of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince might do nothing in theſe Ordinations without the Metropolitan's conſent, <hi>Conc. Nic. Can.</hi> 4, 6. And again, theſe Metropolitans were ſubjected to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. And what is ſaid here of Biſhops in reſpect of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Council, the ſame may be ſaid of all thoſe of a Province, or alſo Patriarchy in reſpect of a General. For as in a Province diſagreeing, thoſe are only to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Succeſſions lawful, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as all are only to ſubmit to, which the Provincial Council allows; ſo in greater rents of the Church, only thoſe, which the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council allows which diſauthorizing of ſome if it be not allow'd, there can be no Unity in the Church, nor ſuppreſſion of Hereſies, Schiſms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If it be allow'd, there can never be two Succeſſions oppoſing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both lawfully by ſuch Clergy exercis'd, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to by the people, after this exauthorizing one of them by a Council.</p>
                  <p>And this is the reaſon, why we find the Canons of the ancient Councils, not ſo much buſied in debating Opinions, as about ſetling Peace, and Unity, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Subordination amongſt Eccleſiaſtical perſons; knowing, that upon this, more than evidence of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Reaſon (which in moſt men is ſo weak and mis-leadable) depended the preſervation of the Unity of the Church's Doctrines, and requiring, in any diviſion

                     <p n="1">1. To Biſhop <hi>Bramhal:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">§. 3. <hi>n.</hi> 3.</note> That nothing conſiſts bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter together than contradictories, if they be not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>ſecundum idem.</hi> To have a headſhip Univerſal over the whole Church, given him by God, or by the Church, (if God hath left to it the diſpoſal thereof) <hi>for ſome things,</hi> and to have a headſhip Patriarchal only
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106806:63"/>over ſome part of the Church given by the ſame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; or the firſt given by God, the ſecond by the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> the firſt by divine, the ſecond by humane, inſtitution, <hi>for ſome other things,</hi> contradict not. To have an unlimited power (if he means for place) for ſome things, and limited (for place) for other things, contradict not: To hold the ſame power or authority both by divine and humane inſtitution, or title, or laws, (which are all one,) contradicts not; unleſs this term <hi>[only]</hi> be added. One may hold the ſame thing both from the donation of our Saviour, and from the dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church too, and from the donation of the Prince too, <hi>quantum in illis est,</hi> which is only a conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt's donation, if they acknowledge it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will theſe latter donations be needleſs, or uſeleſs, <hi>ad homines,</hi> tho the former donation be good; if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer be at any time queſtioned, as many good titles have bin. Again, it doth not contradict, that one as Patriarch be ſubject to ſome thing, to which, in another conſideration, <hi>i.e.</hi> as head of the Church, he is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for the reſpect is changed. Chriſt the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as Man was ſubject to laws, to which as God he was not. So Sovereign government and Subordinate go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the ſame perſon in the ſame Society are conſiſtent. The government of a city is ſubordinate to the office of a Prince in the ſame civil ſociety; yet may the Prince, that rules over all the Kingdom, be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor alſo of ſome particular city thereof, (if ſo he pleaſeth for his more ſecurity,) and may execute in that city all thoſe under-offices himſelf which his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes do in the reſt, or alſo formerly did there, by his authority. A Rectorſhip of a Pariſh is ſubordinate to that of a Biſhop in the ſame Eccleſiaſtical ſociety, and yet the Biſhop may alſo be the Parſon of ſome Pariſh
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106806:63"/>within his Dioceſs, and officiate therein, as is uſual in ſome poorer Biſhopricks. One may be made by the King governor of a whole Province, in reſpect of ſome command which he hath over it all; and may be made by the ſame King, or by any other, to whom the King hath given the beſtowing of ſuch a dignity, governor alſo only of one city in that Province; in reſpect of ſome other offices, divers from the former, which he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe over that town, and not likewiſe over the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. Thus much to Biſhop <hi>Bramhal.</hi> Only I muſt tell you, that he may put his propoſitions in ſuch a ſence, as they ſhall point-blank contradict: but then he will not be able to ſhew, that, in ſuch a ſence, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church affirms them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> I anſwer, That no man can acquire the poſſeſſion of a thing anew, which he already poſſeſſeth, but he may acquire a new title or right to what he already rightly poſſeſſeth, <hi>i. e.</hi> he may do ſomething upon which another law, which now doth not, ſhall give him right to the ſame thing, ſuppoſing that his preſent right faileth, or is queſtioned. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther needeth he, when ſuch titles are queſtioned, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to one, and renounce the other, but may ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plead both; one after another. Indeed when theſe two titles are in ſeveral perſons, one voids the other, the former the latter; becauſe the ſame thing cannot, at the ſame time, be poſſeſſed by ſeveral perſons, (as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> rightly argues in <hi>Rep. to Cath. Gent.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>s.</hi>) but ſeems to me to apply it amiſs to two titles remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame perſon, that the one of theſe will ſpoil the plea of the other. So one may receive a poſſeſſion from a Prince by free donation; and afterward, fearing ſome cavil at this title, may acquire another right to the ſame thing by purchaſe; either from the ſame
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106806:64"/>Prince, or from any other perſon of his Subjects, who pretends to have the juſt diſpoſal thereof. And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may afterward plead, as he ſeeth cauſe, either of theſe titles, the donation from the Prince, or purchaſe from the Subject; which Subject whether he had a right power to diſpoſe of ſuch a thing, or no, yet the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer's plea is good againſt him, and againſt all thoſe who are bound by his act, ſo that they cannot reſume ſuch poſſeſſion from him. So, to come nearer our buſineſs; Suppoſe a donation by our Saviour of ſuch a Supremacy for ever over the whole Church, and ſo over <hi>Britain,</hi> to S. <hi>Peter's</hi> Succeſſor; and ſuppoſe a donation (<hi>quo jure</hi> I need no here enquire) by the Church, of the ſame Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy to the Patriarch of the Weſt over all the Weſt, and ſo over <hi>Britain:</hi> and ſuppoſe <hi>3ly,</hi> a donation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by the inhabitants of Great <hi>Britain</hi> of the ſame Supremacy over them to the firſt author of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: I ſay here, the ſame perſon being S. <hi>Peter's</hi> Succeſſor, and Patriarch of the Weſt, and converter of <hi>England,</hi> may challenge ſuch Supremacy over it, by which of theſe titles he pleaſeth; they being obliged to all; to our Saviour's Act, of whom they are ſubjects, to the Act of the Church, (whereof the are a part,) and to their own. But when theſe three titles are preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by three ſeveral perſons, but one of them can ſtand in force; Or, if any one will ſay, that poſſeſſion can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver relate ſave only to one ſingle title; yet if this be granted, that there may be ſeveral titles inherent in the ſame perſon, of which the one failing the poſſeſſion may ſtill juſtly relate to another; And will come to one, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this; That no other can diſpoſſeſs this perſon, unleſs he firſt prove (not only one, but) all his titles faulty. Thus much that a Primatſhip, a Patriarchiſhip, and an Univerſal Headſhip may be well conſiſtent in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

                     <p n="2">2. What juſt cauſe can be alledged for the rejection of theſe Canons? <hi>Spalatenſis</hi> alledgeth this, <hi>(ibid.) quia

But the diſſenting votes of ſo few in the council ſurely could not weaken its acts; which receive force, not from all, (for what acts almoſt have ſuch univerſal conſent?) but from the much major part thereof. But if theſe Canons, without the concurrence of thoſe perſons, were invalid; ſo was alſo the Anti-<hi>Arrian</hi> Creed of this Council, and their ſentence in the behalf of <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> And indeed hence, where there is any Schiſm by ſome part, no act of the Church can thence-forward be valid.

                     <p n="3">3. Let it be granted, that theſe Canons, rejected at firſt by theſe Schiſmaticks, were afterward for ſome time, in the Eaſt, omitted by the Catholicks in their collections of the Churches Canons; yet it ſeems ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, that the Oriental Church of latter times, when the <hi>Arians</hi> were cruſhed, acknowledged them, as well as the Weſt; which we find done by the <hi>Concil, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopolitan. in Trullo.

As for the ſeveral Reaſons they give, to theſe it may be replied on the other ſide: That the Patriarch, tho he were neither more prudent, nor better informed from others in difficult matters, nor more aſſiſted from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, (yet tis probable, that ſuch might, as having a more choice election, both be more knowing, and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the eminency of his place, aſſiſted, both with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106806:77"/>a wiſer Council, and a greater portion of God's Spirit,) yet muſt he needs be a leſs partial Judge in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; becauſe not ſo nearly intereſſed, in the cauſe, nor in the perſons, as the Metropolitan often muſt be; or alſo other Biſhops, who live upon the place, and are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his power. That the Provincial Councils, which they mention, tho their judgment were never ſo entire, were not always to be had, and were much ſeldomer aſſembled than the Canons appoint; much rarer yet Councils univerſal: neither of them (by reaſon of the great trouble) fit, upon every ſuch difference, to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And hence fails that Apology, which Dr. <hi>Field</hi> (5. <hi>l.</hi> 39 <hi>c.</hi> p. 563.) makes for the <hi>Africans</hi> in theſe words. <q>The <hi>Africans,</hi> tho within the Patriarchſhip of <hi>Rome,</hi> diſliked the Appeals of Biſhops to <hi>Rome;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they might have right againſt their Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans in a general Synod of <hi>Africk,</hi> wherein the Primat ſate as Preſident: for otherwiſe Biſhops wronged by their Metropolitans might by the canons appeal to their own Patriarch.</q> Thus far he. Therefore the <hi>Africans,</hi> denying this, went againſt the canons. That the canons of the Council of <hi>Sardica,</hi> which the <hi>African</hi> Biſhops (then) knew not of, were ſufficient to warrant his receiving of ſuch appeals; and if any former <hi>African</hi> decrees be pleaded againſt him, much more may theſe of <hi>Sardica,</hi> for him. That many caſes are not matter of fact, where witneſſes are neceſſary, but queſtions <hi>de jure,</hi> where the fact is confeſſed; and that in ſuch, no more plea can be made to have them tried at home, than the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Legaliſts of <hi>Antioch</hi> could juſtly have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not to have this matter arbitrated at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> or <hi>Arius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> at <hi>Nice.</hi> That for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of hearing witneſſes, where neceſſary in ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals, it was ordered indeed anciently, that, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106806:78"/>it could ſafely be done, ſuch cauſes ſhould be arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated in the ſame, or ſome adjoining Provinces; by ſome Judges, either ſent thither, or there delegated by the Patriarch, (of which the 7th canon of <hi>Sardica</hi> ſeems to take ſpecial care,) in the non-obſervance of which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops perhaps may have bin culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and cauſed great affliction to their ſubjects: but yet, that other exigencies might occur, (every cauſe not being fit to be decided by delegates,) which required the trial to be at the Patriarchal reſidency, to which the trouble of witneſſes muſt give place; which trials at <hi>Rome</hi> are alſo allowed by the Council, (ſee <hi>Conc. Sard. can.</hi> 4.) And this grave Aſſembly, we have no reaſon to think, but that they weighed the troubles of ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals, as well as the <hi>Africans</hi> afterward, or we now; but thought fit to admit ſmaller inconveniences, to avoid greater miſchiefs; namely, in the intervals of Councils, ſchiſms and diviſions between Provincial, and between National, Churches, by the Church her having thus ſo many Supremes, terminating all Spiritual cauſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves, as there were Provinces or countries, Chriſtian. See Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> allowing ſuch appeals, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, §. 20.) and eſpecially S. <hi>Auſtin, Ep.</hi> 162. where he juſtifies the appeal of <hi>Caecilianus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> wronged by a Council of 70.

See Dr. <hi>Field</hi> (<hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 35. <hi>p.</hi> 536, 538.) Now why ſuch repair was made to him, and ſuch primacy and power given him, beyond all other Biſhops, by ancient Church-cuſtom and Canons; whether from the Dignity of the imperial City, where he was Biſhop; or whether from St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul's</hi> laſt reſidence in this their moſt eminent ſeat, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom there, leaving the Regiment of the Church of God, which they both finally exercis'd in this place, in that Biſhop's hands when they died; (for ſome reaſon there muſt be, that Antiquity ſo ſpecially applied <hi>Sedes Apoſtolica</hi> (when-as many others were ſo too) to that See beyond all others; and that the Appealants, and others, made their honourable addreſſes to it, not as <hi>Sedes Imperialis</hi> (for ſuch addreſſes to <hi>Rome</hi> ceaſed not to be ſtill, when the Emperor's chief reſidence was in the Eaſt), but as <hi>Sedes Apoſtolica</hi>); or whether for both theſe (for both theſe are compatible enough) it little concerns me to examine.

Neither upon this could the fifth <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi> Council be juſtly call'd General, no more than the 2d <hi>Epheſin</hi> Council (which being never confirm'd, was never accounted ſuch), when-as neither the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor his Legates, nor his Weſtern Biſhops, would be preſent therein (upon a difference between them and the Orientals: not <hi>de fide,</hi> wherein both ſides agreed, but <hi>de perſonis; Theodorus, Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>Iba,</hi>) until it was afterward confirm'd alſo by the Pope and his Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern

For ſo it was thought fit to be ordered by ancient Canons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Metropolitans, in reſpect of their particular Provinces; that nothing may be done without them: (ſee <hi>Conc.

Eſpecially ſince it is not denied; That as they can conclude no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without him; ſo neither might He, without Them, (<hi>i.e.</hi> in the time of their ſitting, or aſſembly,) do any thing which was obligatory to the whole Church. He may indeed in the interval of Councils take care of the due obſervance of former Eccleſiaſtical Canons, and, perhaps alſo, for the preſent peace of the Church, (ſee § 18. and below, § 34.) decide dubious matters, upon appeals made to him for the peace of the Church, till ſuch Council meet: for tis both neceſſary in general,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106806:92"/>that ſome ſtanding ſupreme Tribunal there be, where, in the vacancies of General Synods, Suits ſhould be finally terminated; and alſo the practice of Appeals from all parts of the Church, for matters of moment, to <hi>Rome,</hi> do ſhew his in particular to be that Tribunal. So Metropolitans alſo do act ſingle, when their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Councils are not convened, who in time of thoſe Councils may act nothing without their concurrence. But yet when a General Council ſits, it may upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation reverſe any thing he hath done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; correct any error he hath committed; neither do his laws preſcribe to it. To which purpoſe hear what S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, Epiſtle 162. in a judgment given againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> before the <hi>Nicen</hi> Council, by the <hi>Roman</hi> and ſome other Biſhops. —<hi>Ecee putemus illos Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopos, qui Romae judicarunt, non bonos judices fuiſſe; reſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat adhuc plenarium Eccleſiae univerſae Concilium</hi> [Nicae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,] <hi>ubi etiam cum ipſis Judicibus cauſa poſſit agitari; &amp; ſi male judicare convicti eſſent, eorum ſententiae ſolverentur.

The iſſue therefore of ſuch mutually li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited power is only this, (which can neither damage the Churches doctrine, nor diſcipline); That where both (the Council, and this prime Patriarch) agree not, no new law, no change can be made; but all things muſt remain <hi>in statu quo prius,</hi> which ſtate of things is no way alterable by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> for this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, if it give him a negative power againſt what is to be eſtabliſhed, it doth not ſo for what hath bin eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well by the former Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> as former Councils.

(For one may rightly be accus'd of injuſtice, either who doth a thing, and hath no juſt power to do it; or who hath a juſt power to do a thing, and hath no juſt cauſe.) And therefore the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ought to ſeek a reverſion of ſuch ſentence, by preſenting to their Patriarch perfecter informations. Elſe ſurely his ſentence, who is granted to have the ſupreme authority to judg, is to ſtand; and he muſt give account thereof to God.</p>
                     <p>And yet higher; before <hi>Cyprian's</hi> time (about <hi>A.D.</hi> 200) we find (in <hi>Euſ. Eccl.

Elſe, what will this mean which the Dr. ſaith; <q>The firſt See muſt judge and examine the differences of all others, (but none it,) if, it judging and examining, none are bound to ſubmit or obey?</q> And from this, [namely, that <hi>the firſt may judge</hi> i. e. excommunicate (for this is the thing which is meant by judging, above in the caſe of <hi>John Antioch.</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorus Alexand.</hi>) <hi>inferior thrones,</hi> not they it,] it will appear, that the excommunications of the firſt See are either authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and privative in reſpect of other Sees, <hi>i. e.</hi> rejecting them from the communion of the Church Catholick; or, if they are negative only, <hi>i. e.</hi> withdrawing her ſelf only from the communion of others, (of which two ſorts of excommunication ſee Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 38. c. <hi>p.</hi> 558.

I ask therefore, <hi>John Antoch.</hi> excommunicating the ſecond See, and <hi>Dioſcorus Alexand.</hi> excommunicating the firſt, (diſallowed by two General Councils,) was it negative, only, by way of Chriſtian caution; or priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106806:104"/>and authoritative, by way of Juriſdiction? Take which you will, yet tis clear, both by the Councils, and Dr. <hi>Field's,</hi> conceſſion; that in ſuch manner, the ſecond or third See might not excommunicate the firſt; and that in ſuch manner, the firſt might excommunicate the ſecond or third. But indeed, it is manifeſt, That the excommunication both of <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> was au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative; neither would they have preſumed ſingly to have done it, but as having a party of a Council of other Biſhops, who were not ſubject to them, joined with them. Yet thus alſo were they, by the Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Synods, cenſured, for making themſelves heads of a Council againſt their Superiors, the ſecond and firſt See. And as manifeſt it is, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome's</hi> cenſures were authoritative; many times depoſing, as well as excommunicating, Biſhops not under the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of his Patriarchy: as alſo <hi>John Antioch:</hi> depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Cyril Alexand.</hi> As for Dr. <hi>Field</hi>'s very cautiouſly every where joining the Weſtern Biſhops with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the firſt See, in his exerciſing ſuch judgment over other Sees; he muſt either mean the Biſhops of his ordinary Council, and ſuch others, as (according to the exigent) he can conveniently adviſe with which may be conceded to Dr. <hi>Field:</hi> or he muſt mean all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the Weſt aſſembled in a Patriarchal Council. But if ſo; their ordinary practice anciently in judging ſuch appeals and cauſes, ſhews it was otherwiſe; and reaſon tells us it could not be thus, unleſs ſo great a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy could be ſo often convened, as ſuch appeals were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be terminated.

The Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> having patroniz'd no Hereſies at all, as all the other Patriarchs, at ſome time or other, did. Such were in the See of <hi>Constantinople, Macedonius, Neſtorius, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> Arch-hereticks: in <hi>Alexandria, Dioſcorus,</hi> the grand Patron of the <hi>Eutychians:</hi> in <hi>Antioch, Paulus Samoſate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> the Father of the <hi>Paulianists, &amp;c.</hi> All which He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and ſeveral other, which took root in the Eaſt, were ſuppreſſed, and the Unity and Uniformity of the Church's Doctrine and Diſcipline preſerved, by the over-ruling power, the threats, the cenſures, of this See; as any, not over-partial, Reader of the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, will eaſily diſcern. And perhaps I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a little further; That to this day, in the chief point and occaſion of breach, for which any other Church beſides the Reform'd, ſtands divided from the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, the Reformed do juſtifie the <hi>Roman</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent againſt thoſe Churches. The chief matter of the diviſion of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church from the <hi>Roman</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that of the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople's</hi> uſing the ſtile of <hi>Occumenicus,</hi> and the <hi>proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the diſputation in the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> (where both Churches (the Eaſtern now falling into ſome diſtreſs) heartily ſought for an accord) almoſt wholly ſpent about this point. Now in this article the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106806:116"/>Reform'd do ſide with the Roman Church; and, ſo far alſo as we allow of any ſuperiority, we adjudge the prime place not to the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan,</hi> but the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarch. The chief Doctrine, for which the other Orientals (as the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Churches, the <hi>Jacobites, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians, Cophti, Aethiopians, Maronites, &amp;c.</hi> of which ſee <hi>Field l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) ſtand ſeparate from <hi>Rome,</hi> whilſt their publick Service and Liturgies much-what accord with the <hi>Greek,</hi> or <hi>Roman,</hi> is either <hi>Neſtorianiſm,</hi> or <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychianiſm,</hi> or <hi>Monothelitiſm,</hi> imputed unto them; in which alſo the Reformed adhere, againſt them, to the <hi>Roman</hi> judgment. The like may be ſaid in the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter controverſies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church with the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, about <hi>Eaſter;</hi> and with the <hi>African,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Aſian,</hi> about Rebaptization. Thus in the main cauſes of differences with the Eaſtern Churches, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd will grant, <hi>Rome</hi> to have continued ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and that had the other been bound effectually to have received their laws in theſe controverſies from her, they had been better guided; or at leaſt, that, for thoſe 600 years, ſhe happily moderated the great Queſtions of the Church by her ſupereminent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. But if it be ſaid again; That the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> now claim much more power, than the inſtances above ſhew them anciently to have uſed; I deſire to know firſt, before this be examin'd, whether we will grant them ſo much; for whilſt we complain, that they now a-days claim more than is due to them, is it not ſo, that we deny them not the more, but all?

See for this Dr. <hi>Field</hi>'s conceſſions, (before § 18.) <hi>Supreme judge;</hi> for the executing of the former Eccleſiaſtical Canons, and preſerving of the doctrines formerly eſtabliſhed, and determined by Councils. <hi>Supreme Judge</hi> thus, over Provincial, not only Biſhops but Councils, for from theſe may be made appeals to him; and a confirmation
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106806:120"/>of their decrees is fought for from him. See that of <hi>Milevis</hi> and of <hi>Carthage</hi> in S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time, (before, § 23. <hi>n.</hi> 4.) neither ought they to promulgate any doctrine not formerly determined by former Councils againſt his approbation and conſent.

But how far on the other ſide they ſtand obliged to conform to the judgment of him, or alſo of his Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Council, when defining any ſuch new point againſt theirs, (the caſe here between <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi>) I determin not: Eſpecially conſidering the liberty <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> took to diſſent from <hi>Stephen,</hi> and conſidering, what <hi>Bellarmin</hi> (<hi>de Concil.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi>) and before him S. <hi>Austin,</hi> grants, that by ſuch diſſent he ceaſed not to be a good Catholick; and conſidering alſo the liberty S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> took, at leaſt, in a ritual, of practiſing contrary to the cuſtom of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.

                     <p>Thus then Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> (5. <hi>l.</hi> 30. <hi>c. p.</hi> 513.) — <q>Provincial Councils were by ancient canons of the Church to be holden in every Province twice every year. It is very neceſſary (ſay the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi>) that there ſhould be a Synod twice in the year in every Province; that all the Biſhops of the Province meeting together may in common think upon thoſe things that are doubtful and queſtionable. —For the diſpatch of Eccleſiaſtical buſineſs, and the determining of matters in controverſy, we think it were fit (ſay the Fathers in the Council of <hi>Antioch</hi>) that in every Province Synods of Biſhops ſhould be aſſembled twice every year. [To the ſame effect he quotes <hi>Conc. Chalced.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> ſee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Canon. Apostol.</hi> 38.] —But in proceſs of time, when the Governours of the Church could not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently aſſemble in Synods twice a year, the Fathers of the Sixth General Council decreed, (<hi>Can.</hi> 8.) that yet in any caſe there ſhould be a Synod of Biſhops once every year for Eccleſiaſtical queſtions. Likewiſe the Seventh General Council (<hi>can.</hi> 6.) decreeth in this ſort: —Whereas the Canon willeth judicial inquiſition to be made twice every year by the aſſembly of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in every Province; and yet for the miſery and poverty of ſuch as ſhould travel to Synods, the Fathers
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:106806:124"/>of the 6th General Council decreed it ſhould be once in the year, and then things amiſs to be redreſſed, we renew this latter canon.— But afterwards many things falling out to hinder their happy meetings, we ſhall find that they met not ſo often, and therefore the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> appointeth Epiſcopal Synods to be held once every year, and Provincial at leaſt once in three years, [and ſo doth <hi>Conc. Trident.</hi> 24. <hi>ſeſſ.</hi> 2. <hi>cap. pro moderandis moribus, corrigendis exceſſibus, controverſiis componends,</hi> &amp;c.] which accordingly were kept every third year by <hi>Carlo Borrhomeo,</hi> Metropolitan of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain.</hi> And ſo in time, cauſes growing many, and the difficulties intolerable, in coming together, and in ſtaying to hear theſe cauſes thus multiplied and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, (which he confeſſeth before to be juſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,) it was thought fitter to refer the hearing of complaints and appeals to Metropolitans, and ſuch like Eccleſiaſtical Judges, limited and directed by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and Imperial laws; than to trouble the Paſtors of whole Provinces, and to wrong the people by the abſence of their Paſtors and Guides.</q> Thus Dr. <hi>Field.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And much what to the ſame purpoſe Biſhop <hi>Bramhal,</hi> (<hi>Vindic.</hi> p. 257.) <q>What power a Metropolitan had over the Biſhops of his own Province by the Canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, the ſame and no other had the Patriarch over the Metropolitans, and Biſhops of ſundry Provinces, within his own Patriarchate: But a Metropolitan anciently could do nothing out of his own <hi>[particular]</hi> Dioceſs, without the concurrence of the <hi>major</hi> part of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of his Province; nor the Patriarch in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner without the advice and conſent of his Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans and Biſhops. Wherein then conſiſted Patriarchal authority? —In convocating Patriarchal Synods and preſiding in them; in pronouncing ſentence according
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:106806:125"/>to plurality of voices, when Metropolitan Synods did not ſuffice to determin ſome emergent difficulties or differences. —I confeſs, that by reaſon of the great difficulty and charge of convocating ſo many Biſhops, and keeping them ſo long together, until all cauſes were heard and determined; and by reaſon of thoſe inconveniences which did fall upon their Churches in their abſence, Provincial Councils were firſt reduced from twice, to once, in the year; and afterwards to once in three years. And in proceſs of time the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Appeals, and ſuch-like cauſes, and the execution of the canons in that behalf, were referred to Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, until the Papacy ſwallowed up all the authority of Patriarchs, Metropolitans, and Biſhops].</q> Thus the Biſhop. Now concerning what they have ſaid, note</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. That tho Provincial Councils in ſome ages and places were more frequently aſſembled; in the time of whole ſitting, as the aſſembled could do nothing without their Primate or Metropolitan, ſo neither he without them; yet in the intervals of ſuch Synods (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals were too long, to leave all matters of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy whatever, till then, in ſuſpence; and happened ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times alſo anciently to be longer than the canons permitted) the Metropolitans authority was not void; but they, limited and directed by the former decrees of ſuch Synods, were truſted with the execution thereof, and with the doing of many things, eſpecially in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary cauſes, by themſelves alone; but ſo, as their acts of juſtice might upon complaint be reviewed in the ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the next Council, and, if diſliked, repealed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. That, tho Metropolitan Synods in ſome times were not unfrequent; yet Patriarchal Synods were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, nor never well could be, ſo; nor find we any ſet times appointed for calling them, as for calling the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106806:125"/>ſo that, as tis plain by many former inſtances, that the Patriarch ordinarily did, ſo tis all reaſon that he ſhould, decide ſome appeals without them: tho in ſome caſes extraordinary, and of great conſequence, ſuch Councils alſo were aſſembled.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Since, where they ſpeak of the Metropolitans judging matters alone,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to have bin a practice only of latter times; yet they allow this to be done upon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rational grounds: obſerve, that there were the ſame rational grounds of doing it anciently: and again, that the practice, they juſtify for Metropolitans in latter times, they have much more reaſon to allow to Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs in all times; becauſe the greater the Councils are, with the more trouble are they conven'd. and laſtly, that the reformed Metropolitans themſelves, who blame the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s managing Eccleſiaſtical affairs by himſelf alone, <hi>i. e.</hi> without a Patriarchal Synod; yet themſelves think it reaſonable to do the ſame thing, themſelves alone, <hi>i. e.</hi> without their Provincial Synod; authorizing their High-commiſſion Court, and blaming his Conſiſtory. Now what is allowed to Patriarchal proceedings, without Councils, in reſpect of appeals from their ſeveral Provinces; the ſame it is, that, in the differences and conteſts of Patriarchs themſelves, and of other greater Biſhops, (ſince it is meet for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Church's peace and unity, that ſome perſon, or aſſembly, ſhould have the authority to decide theſe; and ſince it is unreaſonable, and for the great trouble thereof not feiſible, that a General Council, or alſo Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal, in all ſuch differences, ſhould be aſſembled); the ſame (I ſay) it is, that, by ancient cuſtom and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical canons, hath bin conferred on the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> with his Council, (tho granted liable to error); He being more eminently honourable than the reſt, by
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106806:126"/>reaſon, of the larger extent of his Patriarchy; of the great power and ancient renown of that City, which in Spiritual matters he governed; but eſpecially, of the two greateſt Apoſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> there ending their days in the government of that See, and leaving him there the Succeſſor of their power. Yet is this office of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme judicature ſo committed unto him, that his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only ſtand in force till ſuch a meeting; and may be reviewed, and, where contrary to former canons, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, by it; concerning which ſee the ſaying of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi> quoted before, § 22. — <hi>Reſtabat adhuc plenarium Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſie univerſae Concilium</hi> &amp;c. and the ſaying of <hi>Zoſimus,</hi> quoted §. 22. <hi>n.</hi> 2. and the Epiſtle of <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> quoted § 25. <hi>n.</hi> 3. and what is ſaid § 22. Now, all Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and Patriarchal authority in the intervals of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils being limited to the execution of Conciliary Laws and Canons, or, at leaſt, to the acting nothing againſt them, if the queſtion be asked, who ſhall judge whether ſo they do? I anſwer, none but a ſuperior Council; till which their judgment ſtands good. For (as I have largely ſhewed elſewhere) if Litigants once may judge of this, when their Judges judge rightly, and not againſt the laws, and accordingly may yeild or ſubſtract their obedience; ſuch obedience is arbitrary. In civil Courts, Princes, or their Miniſters, are obliged to judge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to, or not againſt, the laws of the Kingdom; may the litigant therefore reject their judgment, when it ſeems to him contrary to theſe laws? I believe not.</p>

I ſay here, <hi>concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> not Civil; therefore, let that Propoſition of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> (<hi>ſchiſm</hi> 6. <hi>c. p.</hi> 129.) for me ſtand good, <q>[That a Law, tho made by a General Council, and with the conſent of all Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, [i. e. <hi>of that time,</hi>] yet, if it have reſpect to a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil right, may in this or that Nation be repealed, <hi>[i. e. by that Prince's Succeſſors];</hi>
                        </q> provided only, That the ordaining or confirming of inferior Governors and Officers of the Church; the aſſembling of Synods; and deciſion of controverſies of Religion; the ordering Church-ſervice and diſcipline; the Eccleſiaſtical cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures upon delinquents, and the like, for preventing or ſuppreſſing of Hereſie, Schiſm, and Faction; and for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Church in unity of doctrine and practice: Provided (I ſay) that ſuch things be not reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt civil rights; as they may not be; becauſe all theſe were things uſed by the Church under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperors, even againſt their frequent Edicts: yet could they not have bin lawfully ſo uſed, if any of theſe had encroached on civil rights; in any of which civil rights, the heathen Prince might claime as much law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful power to prohibit them, as the Chriſtian can. And becauſe all theſe were continued to be uſed by the Church alſo under Chriſtian Emperors, without asking their leave to decree ſuch things, or ſubjecting them to their authority, or depending on their conſent, (only with humbly deſiring their aſſiſtance, yet ſo as, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, it, reſolv'd to proceed in the execution thereof as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:106806:127"/>Heathen; as clearly appeared under the the <hi>Arian</hi> Emperors;) yet which thing ſhe could not lawfully have done, were any of theſe entrenching upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers right. For example; the 6th <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> and 5. <hi>Can.</hi> of <hi>Conſtant.</hi> Council, would have bin an uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of an unjuſt authority, if the ſubordination of Epiſcopal Sees, and erecting of Patriarchs had belonged to the Prince. Upon the ſame grounds let alſo thoſe inſtances (collected by Biſhop <hi>Bramhal, Vindic.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi>) of ſeveral Princes and States, on many occaſions oppoſing the Pope's authority, ſtand good and be juſtified, ſo far as he doth not ſhew theſe Secular powers to have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him in any right belonging to him, by Church-canons, in Eccleſiaſtical matters. But if in any of thoſe examples, they are alſo found to oppoſe him in theſe, the proving of ſuch facts to have bin done, juſtifies not their lawfulneſs to be done. Tho alſo he confeſſeth, that this fact of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. in aboliſhing the uſurped (as he calls it) juriſdiction of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> within his Dominions, he cannot fellow abroad. See what he ſaith, <hi>Vindic.</hi> 7. <hi>c. p.</hi> 184.. Neither do ſuch facts, as he urgeth to be done abroad, hinder ſuch Princes for living ſtill in the external communion with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> which facts he urgeth as a defence of the Reformed's neceſſary relinquiſhing this communion. Again, I ſaid, <hi>That no ſuch Spiritual authority can he conferred, or tranſlated to others, contrary to ſuch Church Canons,</hi> &amp;c. Elſe, whenever it is not contrary to theſe Canons, I grant that Inferior Councils, or Church-governors, or alſo Secular powers with their conſent, may change and alter many things, both in reſpect of Eccleſiaſtical perſons and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: therefore many caſes concerning the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> with ſuch conſent of inferior Councils or Church-governors, erecting or tranſlating Biſhopricks,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:106806:128"/>
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (inſtanc'd in by D. <hi>Hammond</hi> or Biſhop <hi>Bramhall</hi>) are juſtifiable, where any wore not contrary to the Laws of the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> of ſuperior Councils: but in any other examples, where ſuch Laws are tranſgreſſed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Prince, or alſo by their particular Clergy, the proving ſuch facts to have bin done, juſtifies not their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to be done, tho ſuch acts were done without any expreſs or preſent controul. Things being thus explain'd, I ſay, (to give a particular inſtance of the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition), No Prince or Emperor, Heathen or Chriſtian, &amp;c. can, for his own Dominions, diſſolve or abrogate the authority, concerning Eccleſiaſtical affairs, of thoſe Patriarchs or Primates conſtituted (or confirm'd) in the 6th Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> (the Church not commanding obedience to Patriarchs at random, or to ſuch as the Secular Prince ſhould ſet over us; but alſo nominating and conſtituting, from time to time, the Sees, which had or ſhould have ſuch preeminence), if theſe be ſince by no other General Council revers'd: nor can any, who by that Canon is ſubjected (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) to the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> deny obedience in ſuch Eccleſiaſtical matters to him without Schiſm; tho his Secular Prince ſhould command the contrary, or ſubject him to another.</p>
                     <p>And if theſe things here ſaid be true, then alſo ſo far as the Biſhop of <hi>Rome's</hi> Authority is found to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, in matters Spiritual, by the Church's Canons, and ancient cuſtom, over any Churches Provincial or National, it will be Schiſm for any ſuch Chriſtian Prince or People to oppoſe it; ſo long, till the like Council re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeth it. Hence; to thoſe three pretended rights of the Roman Biſhop over the Church of <hi>England,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Schiſm is ſaid to be incurr'd, mention'd by Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> (ſee <hi>Schiſm</hi> p. 138.) namely, his right 1. As St <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's</hi>

By the voluntary conceſſion of Kings; I ſuppoſe I may add a 4th, with his good leave; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his right by ancient Conſtitutions and Canons of the Church; and may rightly affirm, that if any ſuch right could be prov'd, the <hi>Engliſh Clergy</hi> muſt be Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks in oppoſing it, tho all the other pretences be overthrown: For ſuch a ſort of Schiſm Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> mentions p. 66. It may be obſerv'd indeed in our wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: That they freely determine; 1. That the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prince hath a juſt external authority in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affairs committed to him by God to enforce the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Church's Canons upon all, as well Clergy as Laity, within his Dominions (a thing denied by none). 2. Again; That the Secular Prince hath no internal Eccleſiaſtical authority delegated to him by God, as to Adminiſter the Sacraments, to Abſolve, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. Again, That the Secular Prince hath no juſt authority to determine any thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Divine Truths; or perhaps other Eccleſiaſtical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs without the Clergy's help and aſſiſtances. But whether ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Determinations, or Laws, are obligatory when the Prince makes theſe, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted only with ſome ſmall portion of the Clergy, and oppos'd by the reſt; or alſo by a ſuperior Council, or Court Eccleſiaſtical: Or, whether the Prince, againſt theſe, provided that he have ſome leſſer number of Clergy on his ſide, may reverſe former Canons, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act new, to oblige the Clergy and Laity under his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion: This they ſeem to me not freely to ſpeak to; moſt what to paſs over, and ſome of our later Writers, when they are forc'd upon it, rather to deny it. And indeed neither is there any thing in the Oath of the King's Supremacy (except it be in that general clauſe
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:106806:129"/>
                        <hi>[I will defend all Juriſdictions, &amp;c.]</hi> granted), nor in the 37 Article of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (which treats of the King's power in Eccleſiaſticals) that may ſeem to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm or determine it. For whereas the Oath in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral makes the King only ſupreme Governor in Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticals, he may be ſo for ſome thing, and yet not for every thing (not therefore the ſupreme decider of all Divinity controverſies). And whereas the 34th Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle expounds the Supremacy thus, [That he is to rule all eſtates and degrees committed to his charge by God, whether they be Eccleſiaſtical or Temporal; and reſtrain with the Civil Sword the ſtubborn and evil-doers]. All this he may do, and yet be ty'd in all things to the Laws of the Church; and to leave to the Church's ſole judgment who are evil-doers, or Heretical perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when any controverſie ariſeth in Divine matters, about the lawfulneſs of ſome Practice, or truth of ſome Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.</p>

And again, an Orthodox Prince cannot reaſonably exclude ſuch Miſſions, who conſent with him in judgment, and whoſe intendments are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.— As this alſo, p. 256. <q>The King and the whole Body of the Kingdom, by their Legiſlative power ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting their obedience from a juſt Patriarchal power, and erecting a new Patriarchate within their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, it is a ſufficient warrant to all <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, to ſuſpend their obedience to the one, and apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the other.</q> May then Princes and States, in Eccleſiaſtical affairs, make Laws contrary to thoſe of the Church? Or, have they a Legiſlative power in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals, contrary to General Councils? I had thought their power had in theſe things been only Architecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical; to ſee things done according to the Church-Decrees. And may they nominate Patriarchs contrary to thoſe the Church elects? Or may ſome ſmall part of the Clergy do theſe things againſt all the reſt of their Body? Or, the Prince, or that particular Clergy erring in thus doing, are the people oblig'd to, or excuſed in following, them in their error?— As this, p. 254. <q>The ſentence of the Law, and the notoreity of the fact are ſufficient [<hi>i. e.</hi> for inferiors to deny their obedience
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106806:133"/>to Superiors] the ſentence of the Judge [<hi>i. e.</hi> of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Concil] is not neceſſary.</q> We know who have lately made uſe of ſuch principles, of Inferiors judging of the evidence of laws, and facts, to the confuſion and deſtruction of a moſt flouriſhing temporal Kingdom. Are inferiors then not liable to be miſtaken, and plead clear ſentence of law, and notoreity of fact, where others as judicious think there is no ſuch matter? But whither tends this? That if we find the Patriarch clearly uſurping ſome power the Church canons have not given him, we are thence-forth free from yeilding any obedience alſo to that authority which the Canon hath given him. Apply this to a temporal Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and it ſeems an unreaſonable conſequence. and we are convinced in it by the example of many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who having made reſiſtance to their Patriareh in ſome injunctions, conceived by them not Canonical, yet continue ſtill their obedience in the reſt. Conſider the late conteſt of the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the preſent oppoſals both of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> in ſome matters (See <hi>Vind.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi>) How can the Biſhop then reaſonably make uſe of thoſe examples, wherein (<hi>Vindic.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi>) he hath copiouſly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed other Princes, caſting off the Pope's uſurpations and oppreſſions, to have retained ſtill ſubmiſſion to his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, to prove or countenance, that <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. might lawfully caſt off, both thoſe, and alſo his Supremacy? Eſpecially ſince it cannot be ſhewed, but that it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely in his power, who hath the ſword, to caſt off only ſo much as he pleaſeth, and retain the reſt. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the ſword in <hi>England</hi> cannot divide uſurpations and lawful rights, as beyond the Seas now it doth, and did here before <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. but muſt neceſſarily cut off both at once. —As this (<hi>p.</hi> 253) <q>When a Steward choſen in truſt by his fellow-ſervants, violates his truſt, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurps
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:106806:133"/>a dominion <hi>&amp;c,</hi> it is not want of duty, but fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <hi>[for ſuch ſervants]</hi> to ſubſtract their obedience from him.</q>— But what, when moſt of the ſervants ſay, he doth no ſuch thing in thoſe matters, wherein the reſt accuſe him; and therefore continue their obedience to him? and alſo the Maſter of the houſe, for the peace of his family, hath ordered, that the reſt in all differences ſhall be ſwayed with the votes of the major part? ſhall not this ſmall part, in departing from the whole, and rejecting their governour, and ſetting up another Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of their own, or every one aſſuming to be his own Maſter, be held guilty of making a diviſion in the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? —So (<hi>p.</hi> 129. and <hi>p.</hi> 134.) <q>Many extortions and rapines, and violations of rights, both Civil and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, committed by ſuch Patriarchs,— are urged:</q> But will theſe things, done contrary to the Canon, make a rejection of Canonical obedience to ſuch authority lawful? Is it a good argument, againſt a King; He hath bin tyrannous, or done many things againſt law, therefore depoſe him and his ſucceſſion, or hereafter yeild him no obedience, where due by the laws? Or, againſt Biſhops; They have uſurped ſome unjuſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or, otherways much violated their function; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore root out Epiſcopacy, and yeild no more, tho never ſo Canonical, obedience unto them? Thus, as we have meaſured to others, it hath bin meted to us again. But, if it be meant, That obedience, ſuch as is Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, to Patriarchs, infers the violation of any civil rights; the contrary I think is ſhewed elſewhere (in <hi>Authority of Clergy derived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from Chriſt,</hi>) more at large, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I remit you. tho perhaps this may be enough to anſwer it, That General Councils, who made the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, were of the contrary opinion to him. Nay, if it ſhould be ſaid, that ſuch preeminences, as, not the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:106806:134"/>but only ſome of the Roman writers, more obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious to the Papacy, give to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> are injurious to Civil rights: yet the Biſhop himſelf, after ſome vehemency againſt them, ſeems to wipe off this aſperſion in ſaying thus. (<hi>Vindic.</hi> 8. <hi>c. p.</hi> 243.) <q>The beſt is; that they, who give theſe exorbitant privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to Popes, do it with ſo many cautions and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, that they <hi>[ſuch priviledges as they give him]</hi> ſignify nothing, and may be taken away with as much eaſe, as they are given.</q>— Which afterward he ſhews in the particulars of his Infallibility, and his temporal power. Did Popes practiſe therefore only what theſe write, much wrong could not be done. —Again, in his <hi>Replication to Biſhop of Chalced. p.</hi> 230. tis urged, <q>—That to whom a Kingdom is granted, all neceſſary Power is granted, without which a Kingdom cannot be governed: and (<hi>p.</hi> 238.) that had the <hi>Britannick</hi> Churches bin ſubjected to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils, yet it had bin lawful for the King and Church of <hi>England</hi> to ſubſtract their obedience from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to have erected a new Primate at home amongſt themſelves, upon the great mutation of the ſtate of the Empire, and great variation of affairs ſince thoſe times.— For to perſiſt (<hi>ſaith he, p.</hi> 241.) in an old obſervation, when the grounds of it are quite changed; and the end, for which the obſervation was made, calleth upon us for an alteration; is not obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but obſtinacy. And, (<hi>p.</hi> 243.) We purſue the ſame ends with them, [i. e. <hi>General Councils</hi>] —that is, the conforming of the one regiment [i. e. <hi>the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical</hi>] to the other, [i. e. <hi>the Civil.</hi>]</q> Thus he; for Princes taking away the Biſh. of <hi>Rome's</hi> authority, (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing General Councils had conferred any upon him) Yet, <hi>p.</hi> 293. ſpeaking of that clauſe in the oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,

                        <hi>[that no foreign Prelates ought to have any ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction within this realm,]</hi> he ſaith, <hi>A General Council is neither included here, nor intended.</hi>) To which tis ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily anſwered; That there is no Church-canon detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from Princes, any of that power, without which a Kingdom is not governable; that the diviſion of one Empire into many Dominions, doth not neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any alteration of the Oeconomy of the Church, as appears in thoſe States, which conforming to theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, ſtill ſubſiſt and flouriſh, without any diſturbance of the civil peace. (But <hi>Quaere,</hi> whether the throwing-off theſe Canons, hath not bin the deſtruction of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; whoſe ruin took its beginning from diviſions in Religion.) —That the Church's end in conſtituting, I ſay not of Metropolitans or Primats, but of ſuperior Patriarchs above them, and of an Eccleſiaſtical Supreme, (to whom, from ſeveral countreys, might be the laſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal of greater controverſies in Religion) was not the conforming of the Eccleſiaſtical government to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, (which end the Biſhop pleads,) but the conſerving of the Church, tho ſojourning under never ſo many temporal Scepters, ſtill as one body and government united in it ſelf, free from being divided and cantonized. Which end is fruſtrated, if ſo many Princes as there are, there become ſo many independent Eccleſiaſtical Supremes. Nay, but rather, the more the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments are multiplied, the more need there is in the Church of but one, or a few, Supremes. That there may not be ſo many modes or ſects in Chriſtianity, as there are Princes. So <hi>Vindic. p,</hi> 145. Many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences by foreign juriſdiction are urged: That (as the <q>Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> exerciſed it) it was deſtructive to the right ends of Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline, which <hi>[diſcipline]</hi> in part is to preſerve publick peace and tranquillity,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:106806:135"/>to retain ſubjects in due obedience, and to oblige peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to do their duties more conſcientiouſly.</q>— (See likewiſe <hi>p.</hi> 146.) To the actual exerciſe of the foreign juriſdiction of Patriarchs I have nothing to ſay: as one Patriarch may uſe it culpably, ſo the next may uſe it juſtly. But the foreignneſs of the juriſdiction is no way guilty of the things here objected. Nay, where are theſe ends of diſcipline more failed, than where this Patriarchal juriſdiction hath bin baniſhed? Do not we ſee in other Kingdoms, not deſerting the Patriarch, the things above-named, both Royalty and Epiſcopacy, peace in the State, and in the Church of ſuch countreys, better preſerved? What former Prince, or Clergy, of this Kingdom, under the Patriarch's obedience, (take him with all his faults,) have ſuffered more, than theſe in our days have done, ſince that yoke broken? What ſubject, trained up in his Principles, hath bin ſo diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient? But <hi>2ly;</hi> Is any one free from a Law or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, to eject it, when he can give ſome reaſon that it is inconvenient? Or, did not the wiſdom of thoſe, who eſtabliſhed ſuch Canons, and ſuch ſubordination to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, ſee their juriſdiction (for example, in reſpect of <hi>Africk</hi>) to be foreign, and weigh the inconveniences thereof, as well as we now do? but they weighed theſe together with the benefits, ſerving for preſerving unity; for doing more entire juſtice being leſs engaged; for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding controverſies more truly, being perſons of more eminent wiſdom, enabled with a more ſelected Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (See before, §. 14.) And now have other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions loſt their reaſon, who, notwithſtanding the foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the juriſdiction, in obedience to the Church-ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, ſubmit to this power? <q>But what if a Patriarch ſhould change the Bible into an Alcoran, (as he urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth elſewhere, <hi>Reply to Biſhop of Chalced.</hi>)</q> "ſhould, in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106806:135"/>Spiritual matters miſguide us? I anſwer, when you can find any to obey, who may not be faulty in his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, leave the Patriarch, and go to him. Are we more ſecure, then, under the Supremacy of a Secular power? or of ſome other Archbiſhop? What if the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular power throw down Biſhops, deſtroy the publick Liturgies, ſilence the orthodox Miniſtry, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> And what if the Archbiſhop change the Bible? or will we be our own Supreams, and blot out the name of Canonical obedience?</p>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106806:136"/>or contrary to her former Canons and ancient Cuſtoms, (as his inſtancing in <hi>Ravenna</hi> and <hi>Juſtiniana prima,</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Grado,</hi> formerly under the juriſdiction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarch, imply, that he means thus); For example: I ſay, it is not lawful, ſuppoſing ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons or immemorial cuſtom (to uſe his own word) of the Church, had made the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop Patriarch of the Weſt, or of <hi>France,</hi> for the King of <hi>France</hi> either with or without the conſent of his own particular Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy within his Dominions, to erect a new Patriarchate, or elect another Patriarch. This I think is plain from the Diſcourſe and the Conceſſions preceding. And he ſeems to ſay the like himſelf (<hi>Anſwer to Schiſm Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd,</hi> p. 164.) <q>A power Princes have to erect Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poles; but if it be exercis'd ſo as to thwart known Canons and Cuſtoms of the Church, this certainly is an abuſe.</q> Thus he. But how it coheres with what elſe is ſaid there, I ſee not. But if ſecular Princes have ſuch power to ſet up Patriarchs within their own Dominions, I ask, whether General Councils have not alſo the ſame; and that within the ſame Dominions of Secular Princes? Will he deny this power to Councils, or at leaſt their power to do it within the Secular Prince's Dominions? But then the Church hath no power to do it at all. For where are the Church's Subjects, for whom ſhe makes Laws, as ſhe thinks fit, but under the government of ſome or orther Secular Power? But the contrary of theſe things is moſt evident; and many are her canons to this purpoſe. The Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> the ſame, upon two Canons of which <hi>Balſamon</hi> founds, and by which the Doctor proves, this authority of Princes to make Patriarchs, did erect <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> into a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchy next to <hi>Rome</hi> (which alſo was done before by <hi>Conc.

                        <hi>Occidental</hi> Biſhops): and this not only to an empty Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or precedency in place, but to a real juriſdiction over ſome of the Emperor's Provinces, to receiving and judging appeals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſee <hi>Conc.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:106806:138"/>Prince had conferr'd upon it; and not, that they ſhould by their authority (as if theſe things were in their diſpoſal, not in the Prince's) continue the Title only, and reverſe the Priviledges, and fix them to their former poſſeſſors. The Biſhop might have been puniſh'd, and yet not the Emperor's act reſcinded by them, as to the new Metropolitans power or priviledges; as it is plain, it was. Yet Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> makes uſe of this Canon (by ſhewing ſuch things were then done by Princes) to prove, that ſuppoſe the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> were Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>France,</hi> yet the King of <hi>France</hi> might lawfully make the Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> Patriarch, and confer the Pope's priviledges on him. This <hi>S.

And again (p. 165.) 'Such power ſtands valid to all effects, if duly exercis'd by him, without wrong to any, [<hi>i. e.</hi> other Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan.]</q> As for that which is urged from the Canon of a Council held under <hi>Alexius Comnenus,</hi> an Eaſtern Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror after 1080, what is eſtabliſh'd by ſuch a Synod, not General, is too weak to overthrow any former rights of the Church.

In the 17th Canon, and the 38th <hi>in Trullo:</hi> Here is only (upon the Emperor's building a new City, (or perhaps upon his transferring the Civil right and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of having the ſeats of Judicature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from one City in a Province unto another), and upon this ſubjecting ſome other inferior Cities or Towns (call'd <hi>Parochia's</hi>) when being the juriſdiction of an ordinary Biſhop, (ſee <hi>Hammond Schiſm</hi> p. 57.) unto it); the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting alſo of the Biſhops of thoſe <hi>Parochiae</hi> under that City, to the Biſhop of that City. Where note, Firſt, that theſe Canons ſpeak only of the ſubjecting of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Biſhops to new Metropolitans, where new Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are builded; and not of altering any thing in the juriſdiction of old; which the 12th Canon of the ſame Council ſo expreſly oppoſeth. Secondly, Only of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting Parochial Biſhops to new Metropolitans; not of ſubjecting Metropolitans to new Patriarchs, nor yet to new Primates. For 'tis moſt clear, that this very Council, that made this Canon, never dreamt of any power the Emperor had to erect a new Patriarch (as I have ſhew'd before § 43.) and much leſs <hi>Leo</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who confirm'd theſe Canons; yet vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently oppoſed the Council ſeeking to erect <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> into a Patriarchy; much more would he have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Emperor. Thirdly, Whatever priviledge the Emperor here receives; methinks their ordering that ſuch a thing ſhould be done <hi>[ſubſequatur]</hi> is far from ſounding, that they yeilded ſuch a thing to belong to the Emperor by right, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> expounds it (<hi>Schiſ.</hi> p. 119.) But then, if the Emperor hold ſuch
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106806:139"/>priviledge from the Church, the Church, when they pleaſe, may reſume this power; for ſo himſelf argues, concerning any priviledges which Secular Princes have formerly conceded to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> and then hear, what the 21th Canon of the 8th General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſaith (if we will truſt later Councils, not far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in time, better to underſtand the conceſſions of former), <hi>Definimus neminem prorſus mundi potentium quenquam eorum, qui Patriarchalibus ſedibus praeſunt, inho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norare, aut movere a proprio throno tentare.

                     <p>Concerning the ſecond; S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s appeal from the the High-Prieſt and the Sanedrim to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> (by which the Doctor ſeems to juſtifie ſuch Supremacy of the Prince above the clergy, that from the higheſt court of Eccleſiaſticks, in matters Eccleſiaſtical, appeals may be made to him, and to him, tho an infidel,) I demand, Whether the H. Prieſt and Sanedrim were the higheſt Eccleſiaſtical Court, or Council, by God at that time appointed for deciding the controverſies of Religion, (ſuch as S. <hi>Paul's</hi> is by him ſuppoſed to be) or no. If it were; then ought the controverſy at <hi>Antioch</hi> to have bin brought before them, and not before the Council of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106806:142"/>the Apoſtles: If it were not; then the Doctors inſtance fits not his purpoſe. But, the Apoſtle here accuſed of ſedition, and, before any judgment given, laid wait for to be killed by his very Judges, who juſtified him, in ſome part, for his religion, <hi>[the tenent of the reſurrection,]</hi> appeals to the Sovereign power for his neceſſary protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the violence of thoſe, who, in Spiritual matters, had no reaſon to judge him. As for any appeal, in theſe matters, from the higheſt Eccleſiaſtical court to ſecular Princes, it hath bin often prohibited to the clergy in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Councils, (ſee before, §. 9.) and is ſo, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, by S. <hi>Paul</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1, 6.) to unbelieving Princes, ſuch as <hi>Caeſar</hi> was.</p>
                     <p>To the third, the Emperors conſtitutions, ſuch as are in matters purely Eccleſiaſtical, tis ſufficient to ſay, that ſuch never were contrary to any laws of the Church; or when they were ſo, were ſo often void, in Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s judgment; who grants the Emperor to have no negative voice in Councils, <hi>i.e.</hi> to annull any of their conſtitutions; but ſurely he annulls them, who lawfully enacts contrary. Such therefore were his Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical conſtitutions, (ſo far as lawful,) as that the clergy conſented to, or at leaſt diſſented not from, them. Which ſhews the legiſlative power primarily in them, not in him. For there cannot be two Lawgivers in the ſame matters, over the ſame perſons, both whom they ſhall be obliged to obey, unleſs they can obey contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. Therefore if the Emperor in theſe Church-matters have no negative voice in reſpect of the decrees of Councils, they muſt needs have a negative voice in reſpect of the decrees of Emperors; and ſo how much of his laws they diſallow, or deny, is cancelled. As for the other expreſſion, <hi>[that Canons of Councils moſtly receive their authority by Emperors,]</hi> ſee before, § 40.

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:106806:155"/>betwixt them, finding the ſame thing aſſumed by Kings as their right, and yeilded them by the Church to be enjoyed by them, thought I might hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this to be unqueſtionably their due; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were from God immediately conferred on them, and independently from the Church, or whether the Church in any notion were the <hi>medium</hi> that God uſed, now under the Goſpel, to confer it on them; truly I neither then was, nor now am, inclined either to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, or to take upon me to determin.— <hi>And afterward.</hi> —If it were not formerly the Prince's right, but the Churche's, then ſure it is become ſo by that donation.</q> Now then if Princes ſhould happen to hold this right only from the voluntary conceſſions of the Church or Councils, or particularly from the clauſe of one canon paſſed in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> (upon which canon the Doctor (<hi>Schiſ. p.</hi> 120) confeſſeth, <hi>Balſamon,</hi> a great ſtickler for Regal authority, to found it,) then I leave to their conſideration, whether the ſame reaſon he pleads (upon the inſtance of former Kings of <hi>England</hi> conceding Supremacy to the Pope) for Princes reverſing the donation of their right when they pleaſe, may not be returned him for the Church or her repreſentative, the Council.

For ſuch rights there are, as, once paſſed away, are not to be retracted; and ſuch as we may alienate not only from our ſelves, but from our ſucceſſors, if ſuch be the purpoſe of our donation. And why this right may not be numbred amongſt ſuch, I yet ſeek a reaſon. If it be ſaid; the King cannot diveſt himſelf of ſuch a right, without which his Regal power (which he intends to keep to him and his ſucceſſors entire) cannot ſubſiſt, I willingly grant it. But the Regal power may well ſubſiſt, without the right of conſtituting or tranſlating Patriarchs. For the Regal power is entire in a Prince not Chriſtian; yet ſuch Prince hath no power to erect or remove thoſe Patriarchs, who have a Spiritual Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy over his, ſo many as are Chriſtian, Subjects. Again; the Prince, when Chriſtian, as now, being a Son of the Church, muſt alſo be ſubject to ſome Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſupreme Church-power (giving to him Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Laws, and (if need be) inflicting Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical cenſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) or other; and ſo muſt alſo his ſucceſſor, if Chriſtian. Neither doth his power to chuſe or appoint the perſon bearing ſuch Office, any way leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ſuch ſubmiſſion, ſo far as it is due; neither doth it impoſe any more ſubmiſſion upon his ſucceſſor, than is due. Why therefore this may not be a right alienable and partable with, I ſee not. When-as the Kings elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Spiritual Supreme to be over him, ſeems not to be like the chuſing of a Chancellor, or other Officers to ſerve under him (as the Doctor compares it, <hi>Sch.</hi> p. 140.)
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:106806:156"/>but, rather like the people's electing a Temporal Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign. Now ſuch people, in electing ſuch a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Prince, transfer not their dominion and power (which every ſingle perſon had before over himſelf) upon him, or ſubmit their obedience to him, <hi>durante bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placito,</hi> or <hi>quamdiu ſe bene geſſerit; bene, i. e.</hi> in their judgment (for ſo, who obeyeth only ſo long as he pleaſeth, needs to obey only what he pleaſeth; for ſo ſoon as any thing diſpleaſeth, he may change his Governors.
